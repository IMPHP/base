/**
 * A stream implementation that can lazyly open files.
 *
 * This is mostly the same as `RawStream`. The differences are:
 *
 *  - You don't have to manually create a resource and parse it to the stream.
 *  - It has the option to lazily open the path when/if it's needed.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      ```php
 *      $stream = new FileStream($path, '+r', true);
 *
 *      foreach (($line = $stream->readLine()) !== null) { // File is opened here
 *          printf("%s\n", $line);
 *      }
 *
 *      $stream->close();
 *      ```
