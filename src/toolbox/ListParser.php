/**
 * A text parser that can parse simple word bound lines
 *
 * This parser can be used to parse simple custom text config files.
 * It does not have a lot of fancy features, which makes it fast and simple.
 *
 *
 * @example
 *      This example uses a simple file list of routes that can be
 *      used with a router.
 *
 *      ```txt
 *      # This is a comment
 *      #
 *      # Route Name   |   Request Method   |   Route Path   |   Controller
 *      # ----------       --------------       ----------       ----------
 *
 *        none             GET|POST             /page/{id:int}   \namespace\MyController
 *      ```
 *
 *      Now we can parse each line of actual route information:
 *
 *      ```php
 *      $parser = new class() {
 *          use ListParser { scanLine as public; }
 *      };
 *
 *      $stream = new FileStream("route.lst", "r");
 *      while (($line = $stream->readLine()) != null) {
 *          if (($line = $parser->scanLine($line, "name", "method", "route", "controller")) != null) {
 *              print_r($line);
 *          }
 *      }
 *      ```
 *      ```sh
 *      Array
 *      (
 *          [name] => none
 *          [method] => GET|POST
 *          [route] => /page/{id:int}
 *          [controller] => \namespace\MyController
 *      )
 *      ```

    /**
     * Scan a line and return the result in an array
     *
     * Finds each word (whitespace devision) and adds it to the array.
     * Each new word will be added as `key` from `$keys` argument in order.
     * So if the first key in `$keys` is `name`, then the first word will be added to
     * the array using `name` as key. It will only search for the amount of words that matches
     * the amount of keys, the rest of the line will remain unparsed.
     *
     * @note
     *      If you need a whitespace in a word, you can escape it using `\`.
     *      Whitespaces are the only characters that excepts escaping.
     *      In any other case, the character `\` is just another character.
