/**
 * An extended stdClass-like class
 *
 * The major purpose with this class, is to provide a better interface
 * to be used as a replacement for PHP's stdClass. What that means is that
 * although stdClass is great when you need an object with a few properties,
 * it's main purpose is to be used for convertion of arrays to objects.
 *
 * Struct is mosly meant to be used just like you would stdClass.
 * But the interface itself is a better datatype to parse between classes and methods,
 * because it does not signal the likelyhood of an array casting. So when it comes down to
 * stdClass vs Struct, it's mostly just the separation of the purpose.
 *
 * Of cause that does not mean that we can't add a little extra spices to Struct
 * while we're add it. So what does it do that stdClass does'nt?
 *
 *    1. Quick/Easy instantiation of all the keys that should be available.
 *    2. Quick/Easy filling of default values.
 *    3. Optional invoke callable can be added with access to `$this` and internal data storage.
 *    4. Only registered keys can be used.
 *
 * The above features extends the posibilities a bit.
 *
 *    1. You can use this purely as an stdClass replacement.
 *    2. You can use this as an stdClass replacement with a callable to do something with it's content.
 *    3. You can use this as a callable replacement that allows you to store internal data for the next time it's being invoked.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      ```php
 *      // Initialize the keys that will be available with 'NULL value'
 *      $struct = Struct::factory("key1", "key2", "key3");
 *
 *      // Fill keys with real values, must come in the same order as the keys.
 *      $struct->fill("Some text", 10, true);
 *
 *      // Change a single key value
 *      $struct->key1 = "Another text";
 *
 *      // Create a new struct equal to the one creating it. The values are optional.
 *      $newStruct = $struct->makeNew("New text", 25, false);
 *
 *      // Register an invoke callable to the new struct
 *      $newStruct->setOnInvoke(function(){ return $this->key2; });
 *
 *      // Call the new struct
 *      $key2 = $newStruct();
 *      ```

    /**
     * A property that can be used by invoke callables to store data between calls
     *
     * The Struct is not to be confused with an easy way to create
     * class objects. It's a simple storage class to optain multiple values
     * much like a map, but more object-like. It has an invoke feature allowing
     * a single callable to be invoked on the object, and some times this callable may
     * want to store a little bit of data, which a single property should be able to do
     * just fine. It can always be assigned as a Struct itself, stdClass or array for multiple
     * key/value pairs.
