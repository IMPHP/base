/**
 * A much faster `Set` to be used when you have a lot of data.
 *
 * So I made some speed tests on my workstation, to compare this
 * HashSet to it's parent. I created some loops that simply added values to
 * each type of Set. _(These numbers will differ depending on the setup they are running in)_
 *
 *  | Iterations | Set       | HashSet |
 *  | ---------: | --------: | ------: |
 *  |     100    |     0 ms  |   0 ms  |
 *  |    1000    |     2 ms  |   1 ms  |
 *  |   10000    |   207 ms  |   5 ms  |
 *  |  100000    | 20991 ms  |  54 ms  |
 *  | 1000000    | + 36 min  | 650 ms  |
 *
 * If you are around 100 values, it does not really make a difference which one you use.
 * This makes sense. Yes there are some overheat with `Set` that is checks for the
 * existence of the value everytime you add one, but there is also some overheat with `HashSet`
 * that it has to create hash values for keyed storage. So around 100 values these two overheats
 * seams to cancel eachother out. But as soon as you are moving to far above 100 values, `HashSet`
 * really starts showing off.
 *
 * @note
 *      This test was done using small and simple strings as value. Objects will be faster for `HashSet`
 *      due to object id's and really long string data will be much slower, because there are more data to run through
 *      when creating the hash id.
