/**
 * This is a light absstraction to dealing with a PHP array.
 *
 * The point of this class, is to provide a way to deal with a PHP array,
 * while also allowing modifications in terms of extends or replace.
 * This allows you to add other features to something that is using this class,
 * by for an example, extending this class, without hardly touching whatever is using it.
 *
 * To keep this simple and as light weight as possible, this class
 * is dumb as a nail. It does not do any sort of checking on things like
 * arguments and such, since this is the task of the implementer.
 *
 * Also it's build on a simple transaction scheme. This makes a simple layout
 * and also allows adding more features, without breaking old implementations or implementers.
 *
 * @note
 *      The bits in the transaction code are used as following.
 *      The last 3 bits tells `transaction` what operation is being performed.
 *
 *      0b00[1]
 *      -------
 *      Performs a change in the dataset
 *
 *      0b0[1]0
 *      -------
 *      Performs a possible change in the dataset size (1 = add, 0 = remove).
 *      This is only read if the first bit is set.
 *
 *      0b[1]00
 *      -------
 *      Needs to re-check the dataset length (Rather than just adding or subtracting 1).
 *      This is only read if the first bit is set.
 *
 *      The 4'th bit is reserved, just in case. The remaining bits follows regular decimal scheme, starting at `1`.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      ```php
 *      $table = new DataTable();
 *      $table->transaction(DataTable::T_SET, $key, $value);
 *
 *      foreach ($table as $key => $value) {
 *          // ...
 *      }
 *      ```
 *
 * @example
 *      Extending this class is easy.
 *
 *      ```php
 *      class MyTable extends DataTable {
 *          public function transaction(int $code, int|string $key = null, mixed $value = null): mixed {
 *              if ($code & 0b1) {
 *                  throw new Exception("It's now allowed to make changes to this dataset");
 *              }
 *
 *              return parent::transaction($code, $key, $value);
 *          }
 *      }
 *      ```
 *
 *      The above class will prevent any changes to the dataset. It's not very useful,
 *      but any class that is build to use `DataTable` can easily work with the modified version
 *      without much trouble.
